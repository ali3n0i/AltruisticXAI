# Market Solution

### The Market Problem

The energy management sector faces four critical challenges creating a $150B+ opportunity:

#### 1. Volatile Energy Costs & Fragmented Systems

* 73% of homeowners struggle with mixed energy systems (smart devices + legacy equipment)
* Complex integration between solar, heat pumps, traditional heating, and grid power
* Average household wastes $1,300+ annually on inefficient energy management

#### 2. Complex, Underutilized Incentive Programs

* $12B in energy rebates and tax credits go unused annually in the US
* 89% of homeowners can't navigate timing and eligibility requirements
* No clear roadmap for strategic energy upgrades

#### 3. AI Tools as Black Boxes

* Current energy apps provide recommendations without explanation
* 67% of consumers express privacy concerns with cloud-based data processing
* No transparency in decision-making algorithms reduces trust and adoption

#### 4. Limited Community Energy Resilience

* Neighborhoods lack tools for collective energy planning
* No visibility into community-wide energy independence potential
* Missing infrastructure for coordinated energy management during outages

# Altruistic AI

**An Invitation to Collaborate on a Live AI Deployment**

This is not just a platform — it's a **working experiment.** We’re applying semantic AI to real-world problems to test one key question:

> **Can interdisciplinary AI solve root-level challenges faster than legacy approaches?**

We’re currently piloting this with institutions like **UNE (University of New England)** but the experiment is **open to any university or organization** ready to think differently.

***

**What We’re Exploring:**

* AI that **learns fast** in specific domains (not generic LLMs)
* Community-scale deployment models
* Generalists + experts solving real problems together
* Replacing “band-aid tech” with testable, sustainable systems

***

**Who This Is For:**

* Research institutions
* Universities expanding in AI, energy, EMS, edtech
* Programs seeking student-first, community-validated innovation

***

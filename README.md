## The Market Problem

The energy management sector faces four critical challenges:

1. **Volatile Energy Costs & Fragmented Systems**
   * Mixed energy systems (smart devices + legacy equipment) are hard to unify.
   * Integration between solar, heat pumps, traditional heating, and grid power is complex.
   * Lack of unified control and optimization.
2. **Complex, Underutilized Incentive Programs**
   * Billions in energy rebates and tax credits go unused annually.
   * Homeowners can't navigate timing and eligibility.
   * No clear roadmap for strategic energy upgrades.
3. **AI Tools as Black Boxes**
   * Current apps give recommendations without explanation.
   * Privacy concerns with cloud data processing.
   * No transparency in algorithms.
4. **Limited Community Energy Resilience**
   * Neighborhoods lack collective planning tools.
   * No visibility into community energy independence.
   * Missing infrastructure for coordinated management.

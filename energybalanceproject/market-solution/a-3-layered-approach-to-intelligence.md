### <mark style="color:purple;">`Key Feature Enhancements`</mark>

#### <kbd>Interoperability Layer</kbd>

Energy Balance Project (EBP): EBP analyzes your system's APIs and features to create customized "recipes" for optimizing energy management across diverse devices, offering interactive control.

#### <kbd>Future-Proofing Navigator</kbd>

Offers a multi-year Energy Upgrade Roadmap by analyzing your profile, tracking incentives, and modeling phased upgrade impacts.

#### <kbd>Community Micro-Grid</kbd>

Join a simulated community grid to track collective progress in energy independence, CO2 offset, and renewable energy usage.

#### <kbd>Transparent AI Reasoning</kbd>

Each recommendation includes a detailed "Reasoning Log" showing data points (e.g., temp, solar output, occupancy, grid price) and AI rules used, building trust through explainability.

\> Outdoor Temp: 22¬∞F

\> Solar Output: 0.5 kWh/hr

\> Occupancy: Away

\> Grid Price: $0.23/kWh

\> RULE: Optimize Heat Pump Cycle

#### <kbd>Offline-First Processing</kbd>

Prioritizes local data storage and processing (edge computing) on your device. The app functions even without internet, and your data is only shared with the cloud with your explicit, anonymized consent.

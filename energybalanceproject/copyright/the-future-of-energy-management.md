Orchestrating All Your Systems

#### Future-Proofing Navigator

Provides a multi-year "Energy Upgrade Roadmap" by analyzing your profile and tracking local, state, and federal incentives (e.g., solar tax credits, heat pump rebates), modeling the financial and environmental impact of phased upgrades.

#### Community Micro-Grid

Opt-in to a simulated community grid that aggregates anonymized local data to show collective progress towards energy independence and resilience, including estimated CO2 offset and renewable energy share.

#### Transparent AI Reasoning

For every recommendation, a detailed "Reasoning Log" shows the exact data points (e.g., outdoor temp, solar output, occupancy, grid price) and rules the AI used, building profound trust through deep explainability.

\> Outdoor Temp: 22°F

\> Solar Output: 0.5 kWh/hr

\> Occupancy: Away

\> Grid Price: $0.23/kWh

\> RULE: Optimize Heat Pump Cycle

#### Offline-First Processing

Prioritizes local data storage and processing (edge computing) on your device. The app functions even without internet, and your data is only shared with the cloud with your explicit, anonymized consent.

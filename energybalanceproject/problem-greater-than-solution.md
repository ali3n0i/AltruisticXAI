<mark style="color:green;background-color:green;">**Volatile Energy Costs & Fragmented Systems**</mark>\
**Integrating** smart devices with legacy systems poses challenges due to complex coordination between solar, heat pumps, traditional heating, and grid power. The absence of unified control systems hinders optimal performance.

<mark style="color:green;background-color:green;">**Complex, Underutilized Incentive Programs**</mark>\
Many energy rebates and tax credits are unclaimed as homeowners struggle with understanding eligibility and timing. Clear guidance is needed to facilitate strategic energy upgrades.

<mark style="color:green;background-color:green;">**AI Tools as Black Boxes**</mark>\
AI recommendations often lack transparency, raising privacy concerns with cloud-based data processing. Greater clarity in algorithmic processes is essential.

<mark style="color:green;background-color:green;">**Limited Community Energy Resilience**</mark>\
Current tools for collective energy planning in neighborhoods are inadequate. Communities need better insights and infrastructure to achieve energy independence and coordinated management.
